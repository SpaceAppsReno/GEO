The G.E.O (Geological Environment Observer) is a device that emulates weather patterns--lighting, visuals and sound--on Earth. The purpose is to help ease the depression and anxiety astronauts may experience in long-distance space flight. Research has shown that ambient lighting, sound and visuals can help combat depression, so the G.E.O is an all-encompassing Earth experience that uses weather data from the astronaut's home city and recreates it through water and sound. 

# Description
## OBJECTIVE

This project aims to provide astronauts in long-distance space flight (LDSF) with a comforting reminder of home. The G.E.O (Geological Environment Observer) is a gray-water powered device that emulates weather patterns and sounds of the astronaut's home city. This occurs by demonstrating rain, storms, wind, and natural lighting changes throughout the day. This allows the astronaut to have a constant connection to their home planet.

## LITERATURE REVIEW

Numerous studies have explored the impact ambient lighting and sound can have on psychological well-being; soothing visuals and sound can help improve sleep and mood. Although research is still being conducted on the impact of LDSF on human beings (such as the current #YearInSpace endeavor), researchers have hypothesized that the stark lighting in space habitats might have long-term effects on astronauts. There’s also evidence that suggests that connections to Earth’s natural environment can help astronaut’s well-being as humans explore further into space.

## MATERIALS AND PROCEDURE

The prototype for G.E.O is made with the following supplies:
- Arduino Uno powered by Intel Edison
- Arduino Wave Shield
- Two (2) Solid State Relays
- Adafruit NeoPixel Ring
- Two (2) 5V fans
- One (1) 24V fan
- Speaker
- Mister
- Water pump
- Power button
- Plastic fish tank
- Plastic tubing
- Procedure to come.

## FINDINGS

To come.
